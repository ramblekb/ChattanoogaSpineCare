			<div class="container-fluid"> <p>What makes IDD Therapy® so effective?
We applied the latest computer technology to the science of biomechanics to create a treatment which allows clinicians to target individual spinal segments, both lumbar and cervical, to gently create space in the vertebrae surrounding an injured disc.

In technical terms, during the treatment, the intradiscal pressure is reduced from a positive to a negative pressure.  This negative pressure may induce a flow of water, oxygen and nutrients into the vertebral disc area to promote improvement in disc health. 

Using the Accu-SPINA®, IDD Therapy® treatment delivers a highly effective and effortless physical therapy session.  Precise cycling from active to passive tensions enable the Accu-SPINA® to deliver graduating neuromuscular re-education to spinal structures and surrounding tissues while decompressing and rehydrating the disc.</p>

			<br>
       <br/>


<p>Using IDD Therapy®, your clinician is able to isolate the affected spinal segment.

Gentle, dynamic movements (oscillation) are applied to the targeted area, first mobilizing the joint and reducing muscle spasm.
   In the case pictured here, we demonstrate what happens when IDD Therapy® is used to treat a herniated disc.

A herniated disc is when disc material protrudes outside the discwall pinching a nerve or causing pain.
   During each IDD Therapy® treatment, the space between the vertebra and disc is being increased, relieving disc compression.

Essential disc fluid, blood and nutrients are drawn in supporting cell regeneration and disc health. Gradually the protrusion can shrink, even disappear.
   With each subsequent session, tissues heal, disc height increases and spinal mobility returns.

As structures improve, good spinal function can be restored and dramatic pain relief experienced.</p>

		<p>What is IDD Therapy®?
Intervertebraltebral Differential Dynamics Therapy is precise, computer-controlled spinal treatment used to “stretch” the space between specific discs to alleviate the pain caused by disc compression.  Compressed discs are the root cause of many issues that affect our bodies: not just the neck and back, but also arms, legs and extremities; issues such as bulging and herniated discs, sciatica and facet syndrome. 

IDD Therapy treatment uses dynamic energy, applied at differentiating levels of the patient’s spine.  IDD Therapy® was developed and advanced by multi-disciplinary physicians including neurosurgeons for the non-surgical resolution of back and neck pain.

IDD Therapy® is ONLY performed using the Accu-SPINA®, our patented, spinal therapeutic device which utilizes a patented waveform treatment protocol known as oscillation technology.</p>
